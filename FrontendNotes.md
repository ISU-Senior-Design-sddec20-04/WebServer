# Frontend
For the frontend of this project we will be using JavaScript with the ReactJS library. Toward the end, we will be using AJAX style requests to access the backend. I will also be using IntelliJ and Atom as my IDEs, but this is mainly down to personal preference.

## React
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ "React") is a strong JavaScript library built by facebook, designed to create UIs out of modular *components*.
To learn about React and how it works, I would highly recommend reading the entire Main Concepts section from this webpage [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html "here").
React is installed, updated, and run using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/ "NodeJS"), which will need to be installed.

Redux is also commonly used alongside React and, while extremely useful, will not be used for this project. For more information on what Redux is and how to use it, watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY&ab_channel=DevEd "this tutorial").

## AJAX
[AJAX](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp "AJAX") is a technique for accessing webservers asynchronously and without updating the entire webpage. We will use this for populating components with data from backend. Some more information on how to use AJAX with React can be found [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data "here").


## IDEs
While IDEs are usually best to leave to developer preference, I recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students "IntelliJ") for programming. Boasting an enormous amount of features, it is also the origin of our frontend project's filestructure. [Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom") is also a good choice, as it is very lightweight and highly customizeable with numerous helper packages for frontend web development.

## Development Notes
- When designing frontend components (or any for that matter), keep them as stupid as possible, only giving access to the barest amount of information following Separation of Concerns. 
- When creating and testing components, there's no reason to make full async requests to backend. Instead, point the repo API to fake data that you make yourself in another file.
- Some really nifty chrome extensions for [React](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en "React") and [Redux](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd "Redux").
- I'm keeping a quick refresher for JavaScript [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "here").
